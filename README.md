Personality-check model
ðŸ“Œ Dataset OverviewÂ¶
This dataset simulates three human personality types:

Introvert
Extrovert
Ambivert
It contains 20,000 records and 30 features:

29 numerical personality traits (e.g., talkativeness, empathy, creativity, etc.)
1 categorical target column: personality_type
This dataset is ideal for:

Personality classification
Behavioral pattern analysis
Feature importance studies
Educational ML experimentation
ðŸ“Š Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
âœ… Univariate Analysis
Most features are scaled between 0â€“10.
Traits like talkativeness, empathy, and group_comfort vary clearly across personality types.
âœ… Bivariate & Multivariate Analysis
Introverts score higher in deep_reflection, routine_preference, and emotional_stability.
Extroverts are high in social_energy, party_liking, and public_speaking_comfort.
Ambiverts show balanced traits.
Heatmap showed strong correlations (e.g., organization & planning, talkativeness & social_energy).
Pairplot, scatterplots, and violin plots helped visualize class separation.
âœ… Conclusion
This project demonstrated:

How psychological traits can be analyzed using data science
How to build effective multiclass classification models
That high prediction accuracy (90%+) is achievable on synthetic behavioral data
